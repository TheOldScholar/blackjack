Blackjack

A simple blackjack card game.

It is a prototype black jack game.

TODO

1. Fix an error in the logic of having the Ace value change from 11 to 1 when multiple cards are added to it, 
and the total hand value becomes over 21.

2. Add a blackjack table image to the game.

3. Add animation for the cards. See TODO 4 below.

4. Add anti-aliasing to all current and future images if animation is to be added.

5. Obviously there should be other issues. Please let me know of any. 

I intend to address all above issues in the near future.
